// Physics Effects is an NP system for doing generic physics effects like radial impulses.
// The goal is to provide a simple API for doing things on the PT without having to modify code.
// This is somewhat of a stop gap until a PT blueprint is available.
//
// The key here is that we are *computing* what forces/impulses/etc to apply on the PT.
// We already have a way to marshal absolute forces/impulses/etc from the GT but this is usually not what we want - we want to calculate these magnitudes based on the most accurate physics data/scene queries.
// Right now this is brutually rough and stubbed in. Will build up a more robust API in FPhysicsEffectDef.
//
// Note on the UE4 glue:
//	-Goal is to have the shared API on IPhysicsEffectsInterface.
//	-UPhysicsEffectComponent can be used to add this interface to any actor (e.g, a grenade)
//	-UPhysicsMovementComponent also implements IPhysicsEffectsInterface.
//	-We just don't want to put this on *every* physics object since their is additional overhead.
