	/**
	 * @brief An allocator and container of collision constraints that supports reuse of constraints from the previous tick
	 * 
	 * All constraint pointers are persistent in memory until Destroy() is called, or until they are pruned.

	 * This allocator maintains the set of all overlapping particle pairs, with each overlapping particle pair managed
	 * by a FParticlePairMidPhase object. the MidPhase object is what actually calls the Narrow Phase and maintains
	 * the set of collision constraints for all the shape pairs on the particles.
	 * 
	 * Constraints are allocated during the collision detection phase and retained between ticks. An attempt ot create
	 * a constraint for the same shape pair as seen on the previous tick will return the existing collision constraint, with
	 * all of its data intact.
	 *
	 * The allocator also keeps a list of Standard and Swept collision constraints that are active for the current tick.
	 * This list gets reset and rebuilt every frame during collision detection. It may get added to by the IslandManager
	 * if some islands are woken following collision detection.
	 * 
	 * The allocators Epoch counter is used to determine whether a constraint (or midphase object) generated any
	 * contacts for the current frame. When a midphase creates or updates a constraint, it copies the current Epoch
	 * counter.
	 * 
	 * The Midphase list is pruned at the end of each tick so if particles are destroyed or a particle pair is no longer 
	 * overlapping.
