	/**
	 * Fast angle approximation by a "slope" :
	 * This method is used to compute an approximation of the angle between the input segment defined by two points and [0, u) axis.
	 * The return value is a real in the interval [0, 8] for an angle in the interval [0, 2Pi]
	 * Warning, it's only an approximation... The conversion is not linear but the error is small near the integer value of slop (0, 1, 2, 3, ...8)
	 * 
	 * This approximation is very good when only comparison of angles is needed.
	 * This method is not adapted to compute angle
	 *
	 * To compute an angle value between two segments, the call of acos (and asin for an oriented angle) is necessary while with this approximation, only a division is useful.
	 * 
	 * [0 - 2Pi] is divide into 8 angular sector i.e. [0, Pi/4] = [0,1], [Pi/4, Pi/2] = [1,2], ...
	 * 
	 * @return a slop between [0, 8] i.e. an equivalent angle between [0, 2Pi]
